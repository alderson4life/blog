<strong>
Analysis of Elliot Alderson's character 
</strong> 
<br><br>

<strong>
Personality Traits </strong> <br>
Elliot Alderson is an introverted and socially awkward character who struggles with anxiety and depression. 
He is extremely intelligent and a talented hacker, with a knack for finding vulnerabilities in computer systems. 
Elliot is also highly observant, able to pick up on small details and patterns that others often overlook. 
Despite his intelligence, Elliot has a tendency to self-sabotage and engage in self-destructive behavior, 
often turning to drugs to cope with his emotional pain. <br> <br>
        
<strong>
Motivations </strong> <br> 
Elliot's primary motivation is his desire for justice and to make the world a better place. He is deeply troubled 
by the societal injustices he sees around him, particularly the influence of large corporations and the erosion of 
individual privacy. Elliot is driven by a sense of purpose and a belief that his hacking can make a real difference 
in the world. <br> <br>
  
<strong>
Conflicts </strong> <br>
Elliot's internal conflicts are numerous and complex. He grapples with his mental health issues and his addiction 
to drugs, which often interfere with his ability to carry out his mission. He is also haunted by the memory of his
father, whom he blames for his emotional scars and struggles. Elliot's conflicts are further compounded by the 
dangerous and morally ambiguous nature of his hacking activities, which often put him at odds with the law and 
with his own sense of ethics. <br> <br>

Despite his flaws, Elliot is a deeply empathetic character who is driven by a sense of justice and a desire to help 
others. His struggles with mental health and addiction make him all the more relatable and sympathetic, and his 
unwavering commitment to his ideals make him a truly compelling character. <br> <br>
